Figure 1:

Clearly linearizable! Consider for example the linearization:
r.write(1) -> r.read(1) -> r.write(2) -> r.read(2)

Therefore also sequentially consistent (linearizable implies SQ)...

Figure 2:

Not sequentially consistent (and not linearizable)!

We can not re-order operations done by thread 2, so r.write(1) must happen before
r.read(2). Since there is no r.write(1) operation in thread 2 its impossible to
have r.read(1).
